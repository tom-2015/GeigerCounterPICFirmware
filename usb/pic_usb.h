// You'll always need endpoint 0, which is the control transfer endpoint,
// and others as well depending on your use.  You don't have to declare the endpoints

//#define USB_CALLBACK_ON_CTRL_CLASS
// if you define it, you'll need to include these routines in your code:

//void usb_ep_data_in_callback(uns8 end_point, uns16 byte_count);

Put the following in your ISR

usb_handle_isr();

Put the following in your system setup routine    

// Setup USB
usb_setup();

// Turn on USB interrupts
void turn_usb_ints_on();

// Turn on global interrupts
turn_global_ints_on();

When you're ready to start the USB subsystem and negotiate address, send
descriptors etc, call

usb_enable_module();
